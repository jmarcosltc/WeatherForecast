### About

This is a weather forecast CSV generator. It gathers the weather conditions for a period of time (defined in the .env) and write into a CSV.

## Installing

To install, run:

`npm install`

And then

`npm run dev`

## Gathering information

If someone wants to get information about other cities, it is necessary to edit the "cities" array of objects locates in the "main.ts" file MANUALLY.

### Contributions

Feel free to contribute, I did this while studying and it is a very simple program to gather information while learning APIs.

### Data analysis

The predictor.py file is just an idea of how it could be used to analyse data.

This project have a great potential on being able to collect data to be analysed in the future, although it requires a lot of time, since this program is very new and it doesnt count with past data. It can have very precise information though.
